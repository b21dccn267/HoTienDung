shattered pd anal
- ask ai to analyze commit 52389cd778be6a2487d6e847d21091c01f25f3a4 v3.1.0: updated version, changelog, and translations for v3.1 release!
- ask it:
	how does the game laod assets
	use of enums, interfaces
	how they transfer to cpp, is it always good to organize code and compromise performance
	how to transition from either (you want ease of code first, then optimize and remove abstractions)

how to make vamp sur (core of coop turn ffa)
	https://blog.terresquall.com/2022/11/creating-a-rogue-like-vampire-survivors-part-1/
	https://github.com/stasiandr/open-unity-survivor-game

remember to write your ideas on readme file

game idea feasibility:
vamp sur game: coop, then later ffa:
	-single flow, single map, one player, hordes of mobs
	-gain xp from kills, level up and get upgrades
	-add two players, add manual combat (only on ffa mode)
	-add ffa centric items
	+ideas taken from vamp sur, ffa idea is unique

tower defense game
	-single map. one player, 4 towers (basic, dmg carry, aoe, support), one type of mob
	-tower upgrades, more mobs
	-turn into base building, have core base, towers, goal is to destroy enemy spawn hubs by expanding there and lay siege
	+ideas taken from thronefall, but attack again is unique
	+mob spawn reusable with vamp sur game

autochess game + mini baseball + match 3/alchemy puzzle
	-single map, 2 players hotseat, 3 character shards(legs and arms)
		many legs = runner
		many arms = pitcher
	-game phases (prepping phase, battle phase), economy
	-build options: traits, items... to allow deranged strats


3 looks too bad
1 is safe bet but can use the work of 2
2 is sweet spot but base building came too late
