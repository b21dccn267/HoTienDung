===requirements===
- must be 2d pixel top down
- must include env, character, items
- must include ui, font
- must include sfx
- include bgm (optional)

- go to itchio to find game ideas (find out what works)

!!! note: you can add pretty assets later, core game comes first

shattered pd anal
- ask ai to analyze commit 52389cd778be6a2487d6e847d21091c01f25f3a4 v3.1.0: updated version, changelog, and translations for v3.1 release!
- ask it:
	how does the game laod assets
	use of enums, interfaces
	how they transfer to cpp, is it always good to organize code and compromise performance
	how to transition from either (you want ease of code first, then optimize and remove abstractions)

how to make vamp sur (core of coop turn ffa)
	https://blog.terresquall.com/2022/11/creating-a-rogue-like-vampire-survivors-part-1/
	https://github.com/stasiandr/open-unity-survivor-game

remember to write your ideas on readme file

game idea feasibility:
vamp sur game: coop, then later ffa:
	-single flow, single map, one player, hordes of mobs
	-gain xp from kills, level up and get upgrades
	-add two players, add manual combat (only on ffa mode)
	-add ffa centric items
	+ideas taken from vamp sur, ffa idea is unique

tower defense game
	-single map. one player, 4 towers (basic, dmg carry, aoe, support), one type of mob
	-tower upgrades, more mobs
	-turn into base building, have core base, towers, goal is to destroy enemy spawn hubs by expanding there and lay siege
	+ideas taken from thronefall, but attack again is unique
	+mob spawn reusable with vamp sur game

autochess game + mini baseball + match 3/alchemy puzzle
	-single map, 2 players hotseat, 3 character shards(legs and arms)
		many legs = runner
		many arms = pitcher
	-game phases (prepping phase, battle phase), economy
	-build options: traits, items... to allow deranged strats


3 looks too bad
1 is safe bet but can use the work of 2
2 is sweet spot but base building came too late

random tips
	z-sorting: what gets drawn of top. default by order of drawing, can be sorted (use for game ui) (ask chat)
		chat says spd does z-ordering by assign a z value
		is int, can be negative, higher = on top
		game engine sort it out


current core game:
	-main character move wasd, shoot closest/mouse1
	-enemies spawn around, in waves
whats missing:
	-all direction gun
	-enemies react to gunshots
	-gain xp on kills (maybe later as this is tied to leveling up buffs)
what to add:
	-fix gun
	-add enemy die function, die anims(2 anims in one)
		die anims can be done by: 
			+have current object possess its own death anims
			+have boom effect owned by game state
	-add hero die logic (touched too much? collision? hp?)	

2 weeks recap
	core game:
		-main character move wasd, shoot mouse1
		-enemies spawn around in waves
	whats missing:
		-hp system, collision system
		-coins/xp for leveling up
			+items system
				+in form of stats buff: hp, move speed, damage...
			+item pick ui
		-pvp system
			+make friendly fire tag on
	what should be fixed:
		-obj pool for mobs
		-one more mob type (either shoots back, or have a melee dash), one more weapon type (melee, make it auto attack)

jon blow expert advices
	when using a mental model for a game (which is good), be aware of:
		hidden assumptions: you may forget if the main char should fire his gun automatically or manually
		forgotten features: couldnt keep track of which feature is finnished, isnt done or is overdone
		drift from vision: subtle game changes may have great impact
	when transforming ideas into code, remember to:
		do quick dirty code to see if it works, then refactor later
		present your ideas, which reveals hidden assumptions and faults


final recap
	when converting to tga, ensure its in rgba + correct bit (eg 32bit)
		in paintnet, set bit from autodetect to 32
		compress ok
	merge gs game and gs play, remove gsdebug, gs game after merging
